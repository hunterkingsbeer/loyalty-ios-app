iOS App for Loyalty

## Downloading a new schema for local development

Loyalty fetches data via a GraphQL endpoint. To develop locally, the project needs to have up-to-date schema files generated.  
In order to do this, the remote schema needs to be downloaded and the supporting swift files need to be autogenerated.

- Ensure you have the Apollo CLI installed
    - In Xcode, right-click `LoyaltyApp` project in the side bar, select `Install CLI`
- Autogenerate the supporting swift files for the schema
    - **Before running this script, delete any existing `Autogen` folder in the `LoyaltyApp/GraphQL` folder!**
    - In CLI, run the autogen script by entering `./autogen-schema`
- Add the files to Xcode
    - In Xcode, right-click the `LoyaltyApp/GraphQL` folder and select "Add files to LoyaltyApp..." 
    - Click the `Autogen` folder and press the "Add" button
